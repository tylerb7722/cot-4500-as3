In order to Run this code you must install the library "numpy".
This can be done by using the requirements.txt file.

# The four following Steps will help you run the python program "assignment_3.py":

1. Open and run command prompt.

2. Navigate to the Source folder, then where the Main Folder is installed usig cd.

3. Type the following command to run the program: 
"python assignment_3.py"

4. You will see the program has run and will see the output on the command prompt screen.


# Running this code will display the numerical computational results for 6 various topics: 

1. Eulers method given Function t-y^2, 
range 0 < t < 2, with 10 iterations, and initial point f(0) = 1.


2. Runge-Kutta method given Function t-y^2, 
range 0 < t < 2, with 10 iterations, and initial point f(0) = 1.


3. Gaussian elimination and backward substitution to solve the linear system of equations for the following augmented matrix: 
[2, -1, 1 | 6]
[1, 3, 1, | 0]
[-1, 5,4, |-3]


4. LU Factorization for the following matrix printing;
A. matrix determinate, 
B. Lower matrix,
C. Upper Matrix:
[1, 1, 0, 3]
[2, 1,-1, 1]
[3,-1,-1, 2]
[-1,2, 3,-1]


5. Determining whether the following matrix is diagonally dominate:           
[9, 0, 5, 2, 1]
[3, 9, 1, 2, 1]
[0, 1, 7, 2, 3]
[4, 2, 3, 12 2]
[3, 2, 4, 0, 8]


6. Determining whether the following matrix is positive definite by checking sub-determinates:
[2, 2, 1]
[2, 3, 0]
[1, 0, 2]
